# RL_Reacher
An RL agent trained to reach a target with actor-critic learning

This code implements an RL agent that learns to navigate to a rewarded spatial location in a continuous space using actor-critic learning. It was used for the RL modeling in the following paper: 

"Exploration biases how forelimb reaches to a spatial target are learned" by Alice Mosberger et al.

Details about the model can be found in the Methods section of that paper.
